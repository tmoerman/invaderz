# Invaderz

A ClojureScript + Quil study inspired by Christian Gross' [Invaders](http://www.christiangross.info/32767-invaders-14-poster/) project.

The program draws a 10*10 matrix that is gradually filled with random invaders in random colours.

## Usage

Run `lein compile` command and open `web/index.html` in your browser.

For interactive development run `lein cljsbuild auto` command. This
command will recompile js file every time you modify `core.cljs`.
